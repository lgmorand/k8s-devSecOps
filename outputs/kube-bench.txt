== Remediations node ==
3.2.11 If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to add the line rotateCertificates: true or
remove it altogether to use the default value.
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service on each worker node and
remove --rotate-certificates=false argument from the KUBELET_CERTIFICATE_ARGS
variable.
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service
