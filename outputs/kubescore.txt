    [CRITICAL] Pod NetworkPolicy
        · The pod does not have a matching NetworkPolicy
            Create a NetworkPolicy that targets this pod to control who/what
            can communicate with this pod. Note, this feature needs to be
            supported by the CNI implementation used in the Kubernetes cluster
            to have an effect.
    [CRITICAL] Container Security Context
        · sec-ctx-demo -> The pod has a container with a writable root filesystem
            Set securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem to true
        · sec-ctx-demo -> The container is running with a low user ID
            A userid above 10 000 is recommended to avoid conflicts with the
            host. Set securityContext.runAsUser to a value > 10000
        · sec-ctx-demo -> The container running with a low group ID
            A groupid above 10 000 is recommended to avoid conflicts with the
            host. Set securityContext.runAsGroup to a value > 10000
    [CRITICAL] Container Resources
        · sec-ctx-demo -> CPU limit is not set
            Resource limits are recommended to avoid resource DDOS. Set
            resources.limits.cpu
        · sec-ctx-demo -> Memory limit is not set
            Resource limits are recommended to avoid resource DDOS. Set
            resources.limits.memory
    [CRITICAL] Container Image Tag
        · sec-ctx-demo -> Image with latest tag
            Using a fixed tag is recommended to avoid accidental upgrades
